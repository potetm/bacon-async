# bacon-async

A port of [bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js) to clojurescript.

Using [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) in an attempt to make the code as clear and maintainable as possible.

The ultimate hope is to have good integration into [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I've played around with the
idea quite a bit and it seems possible.
